This project is a backend microservices demo that simulates a simple video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix or TV360) at a conceptual level. The system focuses on managing video metadata and exposing RESTful APIs to retrieve and manipulate that data.

The purpose of this project was educational: to help me learn Java, Spring Boot, and basic backend architecture through hands-on implementation during my internship at Viettel.
