This project is a backend microservices demo that simulates a simple video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix or TV360) at a conceptual level. The system focuses on managing video metadata and exposing RESTful APIs to retrieve and manipulate that data.

The purpose of this project was educational: folder Java help me learn Java, while folder SpringBoot help me learn Spring Boot, and basic backend architecture through hands-on implementation during my internship at Viettel.

Supports basic CRUD operations on video data

Demonstrates microservice-style backend design

Allows API testing via Postman

Technologies Used

Java

Spring Boot (REST API development)

MySQL (relational database for video metadata)
